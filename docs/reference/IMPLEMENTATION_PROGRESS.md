# Project Implementation Progress

## 1. Initial Project Setup (Commits up to f1886c76)

### State

The project repository was initialized using Turborepo (`npx create-turbo@latest`). The initialization process involved applying the "official starter" template and specific transforms for pnpm and ESLint configuration. This provided a boilerplate including example applications (`docs`, `web`) and shared packages (`@repo/ui`, `@repo/eslint-config`, `@repo/typescript-config`).

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Initialize Turborepo project
npx create-turbo@latest

# (Interactive prompts followed)
# - Set project name (e.g., odin-dropin-workspace)
# - Select pnpm as package manager
# - Choose "official starter" template
# - Apply automated transforms
# - Install dependencies via pnpm install
```

### Key Files and Directories Created (Initial)

-   **Root Files:** `.git/`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `README.md`.
-   **`apps/` Directory:** `docs/` (Next.js), `web/` (Next.js).
-   **`packages/` Directory:** `@repo/ui/` (React components), `@repo/eslint-config/`, `@repo/typescript-config/`.

## 2. Core Component Package Initialization (Commit 841b6913)

### State

The foundational package (`core`) for the Stencil Web Components has been added to the monorepo under `packages/core`. This package will house the actual web component implementations. The package name in `package.json` is currently "core", and it includes the default Stencil starter component (`exerp-odin-cc-form`).

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Navigate to the packages directory (assuming root)
cd packages

# Create the directory for the core package
mkdir core
cd core

# Initialize the Stencil component starter using pnpm
# (Exact command might vary slightly based on pnpm/stencil versions)
pnpm init stencil component # or pnpm dlx create-stencil component .

# (Followed Stencil CLI prompts, likely accepting defaults)

# Navigate back to the root
cd ../..

# Optional: Run install again from the root if needed
# pnpm install
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **`packages/core/` Directory:**
    -   `package.json`: Defines the `core` package (`@stencil/core` dependency).
    -   `stencil.config.ts`: Initial Stencil build configuration.
    -   `tsconfig.json`: Initial TypeScript configuration for Stencil.
    -   `src/`: Source code for Stencil components (e.g., `components/exerp-odin-cc-form/`).
    -   Standard Stencil starter files (`.gitignore`, `readme.md`, etc.).
-   **Root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:** Implicitly includes `packages/core` via the `packages/*` glob.

## 3. Facade Package Setup (Commit e63b3df3)

### State

The basic structure for the public-facing facade package (`@exerp/odin-dropin`) has been created under `packages/odin-dropin`. A root `tsconfig.base.json` was also added for shared TypeScript settings across packages.

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Navigate to packages directory (assuming root)
cd packages

# Create the directory for the facade package
mkdir odin-dropin
cd odin-dropin

# Initialize package.json (likely manually or via pnpm init)
pnpm init # (or manually create package.json with name: @exerp/odin-dropin)

# Create tsconfig.json (manually, extending base)
touch tsconfig.json # (Content added extending base)

# Create src directory and placeholder index.ts
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts

# Navigate back to root
cd ../..

# Create root tsconfig.base.json (manually)
touch tsconfig.base.json # (Content added with base TS options)

# Optional: Run install again from the root
# pnpm install
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **`packages/odin-dropin/` Directory:**
    -   `package.json`: Defines the `@exerp/odin-dropin` package.
    -   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration, extending `../../tsconfig.base.json`.
    -   `src/index.ts`: Placeholder facade entry point.
-   **Root `tsconfig.base.json`:** Created to hold shared TypeScript compiler options.
-   **Root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:** Implicitly includes `packages/odin-dropin` via the `packages/*` glob.

## 4. Boilerplate Cleanup & Root Configuration Update (Commit a7ca27aa)

### State

The initial boilerplate generated by `create-turbo` has been cleaned up to remove unused example applications and shared packages. Root configuration files have been updated to match the current project structure and scope (core Stencil components + facade).

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Remove example applications (assuming root)
rm -rf apps/docs
rm -rf apps/web

# Remove example shared packages (assuming root)
rm -rf packages/ui
rm -rf packages/eslint-config
rm -rf packages/typescript-config

# Manually edit root configuration files:
# - pnpm-workspace.yaml: Updated paths (commented out apps/*).
# - package.json: Removed devDependencies related to removed packages (eslint, ts-config), simplified scripts.
# - turbo.json: Updated tasks, removing pipelines related to removed apps/packages.
# - README.md: Updated with MVP requirement details.

# Optional: Run install again from root to update lockfile
# pnpm install
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **Removed:** `apps/docs`, `apps/web`, `packages/ui`, `packages/eslint-config`, `packages/typescript-config`.
-   **Modified:**
    -   `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: Updated paths (only `packages/*` active).
    -   `package.json`: Simplified dependencies and scripts.
    -   `turbo.json`: Adjusted task configurations.
    -   `README.md`: Content updated to match `6-DropIn-MVP-Implementation.md`.

## 5. Core Package Configuration & Initial Build Fix Attempt (Commit 91a7120c)

### State

The Stencil component package (`packages/core`) has been configured. The namespace is set, output targets (`dist`, `dist-custom-elements`) are defined, and unnecessary ones (`www`, `docs-readme`) have been removed. The `tsconfig.json` for the core package has been updated to extend the root `tsconfig.base.json` and includes specific settings required by Stencil. Notably, `moduleResolution` was set to `"node"` in an attempt to resolve a TypeScript build error related to Puppeteer types (`Cannot find module 'chromium-bidi/protocol/protocol.js'`) observed during the initial build (`packages/core/.turbo/turbo-build.log`). `skipLibCheck` was also enabled. The root `turbo.json` build task outputs were updated to include Stencil-specific artifacts (`loader/**`, `.stencil/**`).

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Manually edit configuration files:
# - packages/core/stencil.config.ts: Adjusted namespace, outputTargets.
# - packages/core/tsconfig.json: Extended base, added Stencil options, set moduleResolution="node", skipLibCheck=true.
# - turbo.json: Updated build.outputs.

# Run build (likely triggered implicitly or explicitly)
# pnpm turbo build # This would show if the tsconfig changes fixed the Puppeteer error
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **Modified:**
    -   `packages/core/stencil.config.ts`:
        -   Set `namespace: 'exerp-odin-dropin-core'`.
        -   Configured `outputTargets` for `dist` and `dist-custom-elements`.
        -   Removed `docs-readme` and `www` output targets.
        -   Set `testing.browserHeadless = 'shell'`.
    -   `packages/core/tsconfig.json`:
        -   Added `"extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json"`.
        -   Set/overrode compiler options for Stencil (e.g., `jsx`, `jsxFactory`, `experimentalDecorators`).
        -   Set `moduleResolution: "node"`.
        -   Set `skipLibCheck: true`.
    -   `turbo.json`:
        -   Added `loader/**` and `.stencil/**` to `tasks.build.outputs`.

## 6. Facade Package Build Configuration (Vite Setup)

### State

The facade package (`packages/odin-dropin`) has been configured with Vite to handle bundling for distribution. Vite is set up in library mode to produce ESM, UMD, and CJS outputs, along with TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`). The package's `package.json` has been updated with appropriate entry points (`main`, `module`, `types`, `exports`) and build scripts. A minor TypeScript configuration issue (`moduleResolution`) was resolved. The monorepo build (`pnpm turbo build`) now successfully builds both the `core` Stencil components and the `odin-dropin` facade package.

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Install Vite and dts plugin in the facade package (from root)
pnpm --filter @exerp/odin-dropin add -D vite vite-plugin-dts typescript

# Create Vite config file (manually)
# - packages/odin-dropin/vite.config.ts

# Manually edit configuration files:
# - packages/odin-dropin/vite.config.ts: Added library mode config, dts plugin.
# - packages/odin-dropin/package.json: Updated fields (main, module, types, exports, files, scripts), added devDependencies.
# - packages/odin-dropin/tsconfig.json: Added moduleResolution: "node" to fix TS/VSCode error.

# Run build to verify
# pnpm turbo build
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **`packages/odin-dropin/` Directory:**
    -   `vite.config.ts`: Added Vite configuration for library build.
    -   `package.json`: Updated with build scripts, entry points, devDependencies (`vite`, `vite-plugin-dts`).
    -   `tsconfig.json`: Added `moduleResolution: "node"`.
    -   `dist/`: Created by Vite build (contains `.js`, `.js.map`, `types/`).
-   **Root `pnpm-lock.yaml`:** Updated with new dependencies.

## Overall Current State

We have a streamlined Turborepo monorepo managed by pnpm, specifically set up for the ODIN Drop-in component:
1.  **Root configuration files:** `package.json`, `turbo.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `.gitignore`, etc., are configured for the current structure.
2.  **Core Package:** `packages/core` contains the initialized and configured Stencil project (namespace `exerp-odin-dropin-core`, build outputs defined). Build is successful. It still contains the default component `exerp-odin-cc-form`.
3.  **Facade Package:** `packages/odin-dropin` contains the structure (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/index.ts`) and Vite build configuration (`vite.config.ts`) for the public API facade (`@exerp/odin-dropin`). Build is successful and produces `dist` artifacts.
4.  **No example apps/packages:** The initial boilerplate examples have been removed.
5.  A root `README.md` provides initial project context (copied from the MVP requirements).

## 7. Demo Application Setup

### State

A basic Vue 3 + TypeScript demonstration application has been added to the monorepo under `apps/demo`. This application is intended for local development and testing of the `@exerp/odin-dropin` package. It includes a basic UI structure to input an ODIN public token, mount the drop-in, and display results or errors.

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Create the apps directory (from root)
mkdir apps

# Create the Vue + TS demo app using Vite (from root)
# Followed prompts: Project name=demo, Framework=vue, Variant=vue-ts
pnpm create vite apps/demo

# Update pnpm-workspace.yaml to include apps/* (manual edit)

# Add the facade package as a workspace dependency to the demo app (from root)
pnpm --filter @exerp/odin-dropin-demo add @exerp/odin-dropin@workspace:*

# Align Vite versions across packages (manual edit in packages/odin-dropin/package.json)
# Example: Changed "vite": "^5.4.1" to "vite": "^6.3.5"

# Install/update dependencies (from root)
pnpm install

# Update root turbo.json dev task if needed (manual edit)

# Implement basic App.vue structure (manual edit in apps/demo/src/App.vue)
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **`apps/` Directory:** Created.
-   **`apps/demo/` Directory:**
    -   Initialized with Vite Vue TS boilerplate (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/`, etc.).
    -   `package.json`: Added `@exerp/odin-dropin` dependency, updated `vite` devDependency version.
    -   `src/App.vue`: Updated with basic layout for testing the drop-in (input field, mount button, target div, result/error display areas).
-   **Root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:** Updated to include `apps/*`.
-   **Root `pnpm-lock.yaml`:** Updated with new dependencies and versions.
-   **`packages/odin-dropin/package.json`:** Updated `vite` devDependency version to align with the demo app.

## 8. Local Linking Test with External Project

### State

The `@exerp/odin-dropin` package has been successfully linked locally into an external project (`webapp-standard/frontend`) for testing purposes. A simple test function exported from the facade was imported and executed within the external Vue application, confirming the link is functional.

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# 1. Build the facade package (from drop-in workspace root)
pnpm turbo build --filter @exerp/odin-dropin

# 2. Navigate to the external project's frontend directory
cd /path/to/webapp-standard/frontend

# 3. Link the local drop-in package using pnpm
#    (Using absolute path for clarity)
pnpm add /Users/username/dev/exerp/odin-dropin-workspace/packages/odin-dropin

# 4. Add a test export to the facade's src/index.ts (in drop-in workspace)
#    Example: export function initializeOdinDropin() { ... }

# 5. Rebuild the facade package again (from drop-in workspace root)
pnpm turbo build --filter @exerp/odin-dropin

# 6. Import and call the test function in the external Vue app
#    Example in a Vue component:
#    import { initializeOdinDropin } from '@exerp/odin-dropin';
#    onMounted(() => { initializeOdinDropin(); });

# 7. Run the external project's dev server and check console logs
#    pnpm dev (or similar command in webapp-standard/frontend)
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **`packages/odin-dropin/src/index.ts`:** Added a basic exported function (`initializeOdinDropin`) for testing the import.
-   **`packages/odin-dropin/dist/`:** Updated with the new build artifacts containing the exported function.
-   **`/path/to/webapp-standard/frontend/package.json`:** Added `"@exerp/odin-dropin": "link:/path/to/.../packages/odin-dropin"` dependency.
-   **`/path/to/webapp-standard/frontend/node_modules/`:** Symlink created for `@exerp/odin-dropin`.
-   **`/path/to/webapp-standard/frontend/src/components/YourComponent.vue` (Example):** Modified to import and call the test function.

## 9. Implement Basic Component Rendering & Fix Dev Server

### State

The core Stencil component (`packages/core/src/components/exerp-odin-cc-form/exerp-odin-cc-form.tsx`) now renders the basic HTML structure (div containers for card info, postal code, and a placeholder submit button) required for `OdinPay.js` integration, instead of the initial placeholder content. Basic styling has been added (`exerp-odin-cc-form.css`).

The Stencil dev server (`pnpm start` in `packages/core`) was initially showing a directory listing. This was resolved by re-adding a minimal `www` output target configuration to `packages/core/stencil.config.ts`, specifically setting `indexHtml: 'index.html'`, which allows the dev server to correctly serve the `packages/core/src/index.html` for isolated component testing.

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Manually edit component files:
# - packages/core/src/components/exerp-odin-cc-form/exerp-odin-cc-form.tsx (Updated render method)
# - packages/core/src/components/exerp-odin-cc-form/exerp-odin-cc-form.css (Added basic styles)
# - packages/core/src/index.html (Verified content)

# Manually edit Stencil config to add 'www' target:
# - packages/core/stencil.config.ts

# Run Stencil dev server (from packages/core directory)
pnpm start
# (Verified component rendering correctly at http://localhost:3333)
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **Modified:**
    -   `packages/core/src/components/exerp-odin-cc-form/exerp-odin-cc-form.tsx`: Implemented basic render logic with container divs.
    -   `packages/core/src/components/exerp-odin-cc-form/exerp-odin-cc-form.css`: Added initial styling.

    -   `packages/core/src/index.html`: Content verified/updated for testing.

## 10. Resolve Stencil Dev Server Component Discovery Issue (Commit <Your_Commit_Hash_Here>)

### State

A significant issue was identified where Stencil components within `packages/core` (e.g., `exerp-odin-cc-form`) would not render when using Stencil's integrated development server (`pnpm start` in `packages/core`). Symptoms included an empty `src/components.d.ts` for the `www` target, a `bootstrapLazy([])` call in the loader, and the component tag remaining unhydrated in the browser. This issue was reproducible in a minimal standalone Stencil project. The `dist` builds consumed by the demo app worked correctly.

### Investigation and Resolution

Extensive investigation, including comparative version testing (which initially suggested a regression in Stencil v4.30.0 that was later found to be a red herring for this specific cause) and minimal reproduction, led to the discovery of the root cause.

The failure of Stencil's dev server (`www` output target) to discover and compile components was due to the `compilerOptions.noEmit: true` setting in `packages/core/tsconfig.json`. While Stencil manages its own JavaScript emission, this setting appeared to interfere with the component discovery or processing pipeline specifically for the `www` target in development/watch mode.

**Resolution:**
- Modified `packages/core/tsconfig.json`.
- Changed `compilerOptions.noEmit` from `true` to `false` (or removed the line if `false` is the effective default).

After this change, running `pnpm start` in `packages/core` successfully discovers and renders the Stencil components in the dev server environment (`http://localhost:3333/`).

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **Modified:**
    -   `packages/core/tsconfig.json`: Updated `compilerOptions.noEmit` to `false`.

## 11. Facade Implementation & Initial Rendering in External Project

### State
The `@exerp/odin-dropin` facade now successfully instantiates and mounts the `exerp-odin-cc-form` web component from the `@exerp/odin-dropin-core` package. The component renders correctly within the `webapp-standard/frontend` project when linked locally. This was achieved by switching the facade to directly import the component from the `dist-custom-elements` output of the core package and resolving several TypeScript module and type resolution issues.

### Key Changes & Resolutions:

-   **Facade Uses Direct Component Import:**
    -   `packages/odin-dropin/src/index.ts` was modified to import `@exerp/odin-dropin-core/exerp-odin-cc-form` directly. This utilizes the `dist-custom-elements` output from the core Stencil package, which is more robust for library consumption by external bundlers.
    -   Removed the previous Stencil loader (`defineCustomElements`) logic from the facade.
    -   The `OdinDropin` class's `mount` method is now synchronous as it no longer needs to manage loader initialization.

-   **TypeScript Module Resolution for Exports:**
    -   Encountered a Vite build error: `[commonjs--resolver] Missing "./dist/components/exerp-odin-cc-form.js" specifier in "@exerp/odin-dropin-core" package`.
    -   **Resolution:** Changed the facade's import statement from the deep path `...@core/dist/components/exerp-odin-cc-form.js` to `...@core/exerp-odin-cc-form`, which correctly uses the `exports` map defined in `packages/core/package.json`.

-   **TypeScript Type Resolution (`HTMLExerpOdinCcFormElement`):**
    -   The `odin-dropin` facade build failed with `error TS2304: Cannot find name 'HTMLExerpOdinCcFormElement'`.
    -   **Initial Attempts (Project References):** Added `composite: true` and `declarationMap: true` to `packages/core/tsconfig.json`, and `composite: true` with `"references": [{ "path": "../core" }]` to `packages/odin-dropin/tsconfig.json`. While good for monorepo structure, this alone didn't resolve the Vite build error for the facade.
    -   **Error Insight:** A subsequent TypeScript error (`TS2307: Cannot find module ... or its corresponding type declarations. ... Consider updating to 'node16', 'nodenext', or 'bundler'`) indicated the `moduleResolution` setting was the culprit for type imports across packages respecting the `exports` map.
    -   **Resolution (Module Resolution):**
        -   Updated `tsconfig.base.json` to set `compilerOptions.moduleResolution: "bundler"`.
        -   Removed overriding `moduleResolution: "node"` from `packages/core/tsconfig.json` and `packages/odin-dropin/tsconfig.json` to allow inheritance.
    -   **Resolution (Explicit Type Import):** Added `import type { HTMLExerpOdinCcFormElement } from '@exerp/odin-dropin-core/exerp-odin-cc-form';` to `packages/odin-dropin/src/index.ts`. This, combined with the correct `moduleResolution`, allowed Vite/`vite-plugin-dts` to find the type.

-   **DOM Ready for Mounting in Vue (`webapp-standard`):**
    -   The `OdinDropInHost.vue` component in `webapp-standard` initially had an error where the drop-in tried to mount before its container `div` was rendered (due to `v-if`/`v-else` logic).
    -   **Resolution:** Used `this.$nextTick()` in `OdinDropInHost.ts` to ensure the DOM is updated and the container element exists before calling the `mount` method.

### Key Files Modified:
-   **`packages/odin-dropin/src/index.ts`:** Updated to use direct component import and explicit type import. `OdinDropin.mount()` is now synchronous.
-   **`packages/odin-dropin/tsconfig.json`:** Ensured it inherits `moduleResolution: "bundler"`.
-   **`packages/core/tsconfig.json`:** Ensured it inherits `moduleResolution: "bundler"`, added `composite: true`, `declarationMap: true`.
-   **`tsconfig.base.json`:** Set `moduleResolution: "bundler"`.
-   **`webapp-standard/frontend/src/views/payment-providers/odin-drop-in/OdinDropInHost.ts`:** Used `nextTick` for mounting, reverted `await` on mount call.
-   (Removed `vue.config.js` if it was added for `copy-webpack-plugin` in `webapp-standard` as it's no longer needed for this approach).

### Current Status:
-   The `exerp-odin-cc-form` component renders successfully in `webapp-standard`.
-   The build process for both `core` and `odin-dropin` packages is successful.
-   Type checking for the facade package is passing.

## 12. Implement Drop-in Rendering in Demo App

### State
The `apps/demo/src/App.vue` component has been updated to correctly import, initialize, and mount the `@exerp/odin-dropin` facade. This allows the `exerp-odin-cc-form` web component to be rendered within the demo application for interactive testing.

### Key Changes:
-   **`apps/demo/src/App.vue`:**
    -   Imported the `OdinDropin` class from `@exerp/odin-dropin`.
    -   Implemented the `initializeAndMountDropin` method:
        -   Instantiates `OdinDropin` with the provided public token and basic `onSubmit`/`onError` callbacks.
        -   Calls the `mount()` method of the `OdinDropin` instance, targeting a `div` element referenced by `dropinContainerRef`.
        -   Added logic to unmount any previous instance if the button is clicked multiple times.
        -   Used `nextTick` before mounting to ensure the DOM is ready.
    -   The demo app now successfully renders the `exerp-odin-cc-form` component when a public token is provided and the "Initialize & Mount Drop-in" button is clicked.

### Current Status:
-   The demo application (`apps/demo`) can now visually render the basic structure of the ODIN CC form component.
-   The core Stencil component is being correctly mounted via the facade.
-   Next steps will involve passing properties to the Stencil component and handling callbacks from `OdinPay.js`.

## 13. Implement OdinPay.js Integration, Callback Handling, and UI States

### State
The `exerp-odin-cc-form` Stencil component (`packages/core`) now fully integrates `OdinPay.js` to render the credit card and postal code fields. It dynamically loads the `OdinPay.js` script, initializes the `OdinPay` object using the `odinPublicToken` prop, and calls `createCardForm` to display the payment inputs. The `isSingleUse` prop is also passed from the facade to the core component and used in `createCardForm`.

The component now correctly handles the `result` object structure returned by the `OdinPay.js` callback (`result.success`, `result.paymentMethod`, `result.message`), including parsing `result.message` when it's an object (e.g., for validation errors). It emits `odinSubmitInternal` (with `paymentMethodId`) on success and `odinErrorInternal` (with error message) on failure.

UI state management has been implemented:
- A loading state (`isLoading`) disables the submit button and shows "Loading..." text during initialization and submission. (Note: Submission loading relies on the two-button pattern).
- Initialization and submission errors (`initializationError`, `callbackError`) are displayed directly within the component's UI.

The `@exerp/odin-dropin` facade correctly passes the `isSingleUse` prop and listens for the `odinSubmitInternal`/`odinErrorInternal` events, invoking the host application's `onSubmit`/`onError` callbacks. The host application (`webapp-standard`) successfully provides button styling via Tailwind, confirming the host-styling strategy.

### Key Changes & Resolutions:

-   **Core Component (`packages/core/src/components/exerp-odin-cc-form/exerp-odin-cc-form.tsx`):**
    -   Retained dynamic `loadScript` and `OdinPay` initialization logic.
    -   Retained `@Prop()` for `odinPublicToken` and `isSingleUse`.
    -   Retained `@Event()` emitters for `odinSubmitInternal` and `odinErrorInternal`. Updated `OdinPayErrorPayload` interface based on callback results.
    -   **Callback Update:** The callback provided to `createCardForm` now checks `result.success` (boolean).
        -   On `success: true`, it extracts `result.paymentMethod.id` and emits `odinSubmitInternal`.
        -   On `success: false`, it extracts the error from `result.message` (handling both string and object types) and emits `odinErrorInternal`.
    -   **Loading State:** Implemented `isLoading` state. Uses a visible button (user clicks) and a hidden button (OdinPay targets). `isLoading` is set true on visible button click and false in the OdinPay callback.
    -   **Error Display:** Added `callbackError` state. The `render()` method now displays the content of `callbackError` in a designated error message container.
    -   **Button State:** The visible submit button is disabled based on the `isLoading` state and whether the form has rendered (`!this.formRendered`).

-   **Facade (`packages/odin-dropin/src/index.ts`):**
    -   Confirmed it passes `isSingleUse` correctly.
    -   Confirmed event listeners (`odinSubmitInternal`, `odinErrorInternal`) are attached and correctly trigger host callbacks (`onSubmit`, `onError`).

-   **Host Styling (`webapp-standard/src/views/payment-providers/odin-drop-in/OdinDropInHost.vue`):**
    -   Removed background/color styles from `.odin-submit-button` in `exerp-odin-cc-form.css` (component styles).
    -   Added Tailwind styles using `@apply` within `OdinDropInHost.vue`'s `<style>` block, targeting `.odin-submit-button` (using `:deep()`). This successfully styled the button according to the host application's theme, validating the minimal-component + host-styling strategy.

### Current Status:
-   The ODIN CC form renders correctly via `OdinPay.js`.
-   `isSingleUse` configuration is handled.
-   Loading state during submission is functional.
-   Successful submissions and errors (including validation errors) are correctly processed, emitted, and displayed in the UI and relayed to the host app.
-   Host application styling is successfully applied.
-   The core MVP functionality is complete and robust callback handling is implemented.

## 14. Implement Mandatory Country Code Support

### State
The ODIN Drop-in component now requires a `countryCode` ('US' or 'CA') to be specified during initialization. This code is passed from the host application, through the facade, down to the core Stencil component, and used when initializing `OdinPay.js` via its `country` option. This ensures the payment form is configured for the correct region. An issue with `OdinPay.js` options parsing (where providing both `country` and a top-level `input` theme object caused errors) was identified and worked around by ensuring the theme is passed as a nested object (`{ country: 'US', theme: { ... } }`).

### Key Changes & Resolutions:

-   **Core Component (`packages/core/src/components/exerp-odin-cc-form/exerp-odin-cc-form.tsx`):**
    -   Added a mandatory `countryCode!: 'US' | 'CA'` prop.
    -   Updated `componentDidLoad` and added `watchCountryCode` to re-initialize `OdinPay` if the prop changes or is initially set.
    -   Modified `initializeOdinPayAndForm` to pass `{ country: this.countryCode, theme: { ... } }` as the options to `OdinPay()`. This structure works around an identified `OdinPay.js` bug related to option parsing.
    -   Added error handling for missing `countryCode`.
-   **Facade (`packages/odin-dropin/src/index.ts`):**
    -   Updated `OdinDropinInitializationParams` to include a mandatory `countryCode: 'US' | 'CA'`.
    -   The `OdinDropin` constructor and `mount` method now handle and pass the `countryCode` to the core web component.
    -   Added error handling if `countryCode` is missing during facade initialization.
-   **Demo App (`apps/demo/src/App.vue`):**
    -   Added a `<select>` dropdown for users to choose 'US' or 'CA'.
    -   The selected `countryCode` is passed during `OdinDropin` initialization.
-   **Documentation:**
    -   Updated `packages/core/.../readme.md` (auto-updated by Stencil) and `packages/odin-dropin/README.md` to reflect the new mandatory `countryCode` parameter.
    -   Updated `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md`.

### Current Status:
-   `countryCode` is successfully passed through all layers.
-   `OdinPay.js` is initialized with the correct country and theme structure.
-   The demo application allows testing with different country codes.
-   The previously observed `TypeError` related to `OdinPay.js` option parsing is resolved.

## 15. Implement Optional "Name on Card" Billing Field

### State
The ODIN Drop-in component now supports an optional "Name on Card" billing field. This is controlled via a new `billingFieldsConfig` object passed during initialization.

### Key Changes & Resolutions:

-   **Core Component (`packages/core/src/components/exerp-odin-cc-form/exerp-odin-cc-form.tsx`):**
    -   Defined a `BillingFieldsConfig` interface (initially `{ name?: boolean }`).
    -   Added an optional `billingFieldsConfig?: BillingFieldsConfig` prop.
    -   The `render()` method conditionally renders the "Name on Card" field's `div` container and `label` if `billingFieldsConfig.name` is true.
    -   `renderOdinForm()` dynamically adds the `name` field configuration (selector, placeholder) to the `fields` object passed to `OdinPay.createCardForm()` if enabled.
    -   Generated a unique ID for the name field container.
-   **Facade (`packages/odin-dropin/src/index.ts`):**
    -   Imported and re-exported `BillingFieldsConfig` from the core package.
    -   Added an optional `billingFieldsConfig?: BillingFieldsConfig` to `OdinDropinInitializationParams`.
    -   The `mount` method passes the `billingFieldsConfig` to the core web component.
-   **Demo App (`apps/demo/src/App.vue`):**
    -   Added a checkbox to toggle `enableNameField`.
    *   A computed property `currentBillingFieldsConfig` creates the config object `{ name: enableNameField.value }` and passes it to `OdinDropin`.
-   **Documentation:**
    -   Updated `packages/core/.../readme.md` (auto-updated by Stencil) and `packages/odin-dropin/README.md` for the new `billingFieldsConfig` parameter.
    -   Updated `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md`.

### Current Status:
-   The "Name on Card" field can be dynamically shown or hidden in the demo app.
-   `OdinPay.js` correctly renders the field when configured.
-   The basic infrastructure for adding more optional billing fields is now in place.

## 16. Enhance Success Payload with Detailed Payment Method Information

### State
The `OdinSubmitPayload` returned by the facade's `onSubmit` callback has been enhanced to include more detailed information about the tokenized payment method. This provides integrators with richer data beyond just the `paymentMethodId` and `billingInformation`.

### Key Changes & Resolutions:
-   **Core Component & Facade Types (`OdinPaySubmitPayload`):**
    -   Added `paymentMethodType: 'CARD'` to the payload.
    -   Introduced a `details` object within the payload, typed as `CardPaymentMethodDetails`.
    -   `CardPaymentMethodDetails` includes `cardBrand?`, `last4?`, `maskedAccountNumber?`, `expirationDate?`, and `binDetails?`.
    -   Defined placeholder types for future `AchPaymentMethodDetails` and a union `PaymentMethodSpecificDetails` for extensibility.
-   **Core Component Logic (`exerp-odin-cc-form.tsx`):**
    -   Updated to extract `cardBrand`, `accountNumber` (for `maskedAccountNumber` and `last4`), `expirationDate`, and `binDetails` from the `OdinPay.js` success result.
    -   Populates and emits these details in the new `OdinSubmitPayload` structure via the `odinSubmitInternal` event.
-   **Facade (`odin-dropin/index.ts`):**
    -   Updated to re-export the new and modified types related to the success payload.
-   **Demo Application (`apps/demo/App.vue`):**
    -   Modified the "Results" section to display the new fields: `paymentMethodType`, `cardBrand`, `last4`, `maskedAccountNumber`, `expirationDate`, and `binDetails`.
-   **Documentation:**
    -   Updated `packages/odin-dropin/README.md` and `docs/design/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` to reflect the new success payload structure.

### Current Status:
-   The facade now provides a more detailed success payload.
-   The demo application correctly displays this additional information.
-   Relevant documentation has been updated.
