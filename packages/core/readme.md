# Exerp ODIN Drop-in Core Components (`@exerp/odin-dropin-core`)

This package contains the internal core Web Components (built with Stencil.js) used by the main `@exerp/odin-dropin` facade library.

**Note:** This is an internal implementation package. Host applications should **not** consume this package directly. Please use the `@exerp/odin-dropin` package instead.

## Development

Refer to the main workspace [README.md](../../README.md) and [QUICK_START.md](../../QUICK_START.md) for development instructions, including how to build and test these components in isolation using the Stencil development server.
