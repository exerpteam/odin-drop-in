# Project Initialization

## Current State

The project repository has been initialized using Turborepo. The initialization process involved applying the "official starter" template and specific transforms for pnpm and ESLint configuration. This provides a comprehensive boilerplate including example applications (`docs`, `web`) and shared packages (`@repo/ui`, `@repo/eslint-config`, `@repo/typescript-config`).

## Commands Executed & Process

The following command initiated the project setup:

```bash
npx create-turbo@latest
```

During the interactive setup, the following choices were made:
1.  Project name was likely set (e.g., `odin-dropin-workspace`).
2.  `pnpm` was selected as the package manager.
3.  The "official starter" template was chosen and applied (reflecting commit `df9dcf79`).
4.  An automated ESLint configuration adjustment for pnpm/flat config likely occurred (reflecting commit `23296b00`).

## Key Files and Directories Created

This initialization process resulted in the standard Turborepo structure populated with the official starter content:

-   **Root Files:**
    -   `.git/`: Git repository directory.
    -   `.gitignore`: Standard Git ignore file.
    -   `package.json`: Root package.json defining workspaces and scripts (`build`, `dev`, `lint`, `format`, `check-types`).
    -   `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: Defines the pnpm workspace structure (`apps/*`, `packages/*`).
    -   `turbo.json`: Turborepo configuration file, defining tasks and pipelines.
    -   `README.md`: Default Turborepo starter README.
-   **`apps/` Directory:** Contains example applications:
    -   `docs/`: A Next.js application.
    -   `web/`: Another Next.js application.
-   **`packages/` Directory:** Contains example shared packages:
    -   `@repo/ui/`: A stub React component library (e.g., Button, Card).
    -   `@repo/eslint-config/`: Shared ESLint configurations (base, next.js, react-internal) using flat config (`.js` files).
    -   `@repo/typescript-config/`: Shared TypeScript configurations (base, nextjs, react-library).

## Summary

We have a functional monorepo structure managed by Turborepo and pnpm. It includes the necessary configuration files and example applications/packages based on the "official starter" template, with appropriate ESLint settings established.

The next steps involve:
1.  Removing or modifying the example apps (`docs`, `web`) and packages (`@repo/ui`).
2.  Creating our specific packages (`core` for Stencil, `odin-dropin` for the facade, `demo` for testing) as outlined in the MVP requirements.
