# Project Initialization

## Current State

The project repository has been initialized using Turborepo's official starter template. This provides a more comprehensive boilerplate including example applications and shared packages.

## Command Executed

The following command was run to initialize the project:

```bash
npx create-turbo@latest
```

(During the `create-turbo` process, `pnpm` was selected as the package manager, a project name like `odin-payments-dropin` might have been chosen, and the "official starter" template was applied).

## Key Files and Directories Created

This initialization step created the standard Turborepo structure along with starter content:

-   **Root Files:**
    -   `.git/`: Git repository directory.
    -   `.gitignore`: Standard Git ignore file.
    -   `package.json`: Root package.json defining workspaces and scripts (`build`, `dev`, `lint`, `format`).
    -   `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: Defines the pnpm workspace structure (`apps/*`, `packages/*`).
    -   `turbo.json`: Turborepo configuration file, defining tasks and pipelines.
    -   `README.md`: Default Turborepo starter README.
-   **`apps/` Directory:** Contains example applications:
    -   `docs/`: A Next.js application.
    -   `web/`: Another Next.js application.
-   **`packages/` Directory:** Contains example shared packages:
    -   `@repo/ui/`: A stub React component library (e.g., Button, Card).
    -   `@repo/eslint-config/`: Shared ESLint configurations (base, next.js, react-internal).
    -   `@repo/typescript-config/`: Shared TypeScript configurations (base, nextjs, react-library).

## Summary

We have a foundational monorepo structure managed by Turborepo and pnpm. It includes the necessary configuration files and example applications/packages based on the official starter template. The next steps will involve removing or modifying the example apps/packages and creating our specific packages (`core`, `odin-dropin`, `demo`) as defined in the MVP document.
