# Project Implementation Progress

## 1. Initial Project Setup (Commits up to f1886c76)

### State

The project repository was initialized using Turborepo. The initialization process involved applying the "official starter" template and specific transforms for pnpm and ESLint configuration. This provided a comprehensive boilerplate including example applications (`docs`, `web`) and shared packages (`@repo/ui`, `@repo/eslint-config`, `@repo/typescript-config`).

### Commands Executed & Process

The following command initiated the project setup:

```bash
npx create-turbo@latest
```

During the interactive setup:
1.  A project name was likely set (e.g., `odin-dropin-workspace`).
2.  `pnpm` was selected as the package manager.
3.  The "official starter" template was chosen.
4.  Automated ESLint configuration adjustments were applied.
5.  Dependencies were installed via `pnpm install`.

### Key Files and Directories Created (Initial)

-   **Root Files:** `.git/`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `README.md`.
-   **`apps/` Directory:** `docs/` (Next.js), `web/` (Next.js).
-   **`packages/` Directory:** `@repo/ui/` (React components), `@repo/eslint-config/`, `@repo/typescript-config/`.

## 2. Core Component Package Initialization (Commit 861ee0c)

### State

The foundational package for the Stencil Web Components has been added to the monorepo.

### Commands Executed & Process

Inside the `packages/` directory, the `core` package was initialized using the Stencil CLI starter for components.

```bash
# Navigate to the packages directory (assuming you are at the root)
cd packages

# Create the directory for the core package
mkdir core
cd core

# Initialize the Stencil component starter
# (Using pnpm's equivalent of npx)
pnpm init stencil component
# or: pnpm dlx create-stencil component core

# Follow Stencil CLI prompts (likely accepting defaults)
# ...

# Navigate back to the root
cd ../..

# Optional: Run install again from the root if needed after manual package.json changes
# pnpm install
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **`packages/core/` Directory:**
    -   `package.json`: Defines the `core` package, including `@stencil/core` dependency.
    -   `stencil.config.ts`: Stencil build configuration file.
    -   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration for the Stencil project.
    -   `src/`: Contains the source code for Stencil components (e.g., `components/my-component/`, `index.ts`, `utils/`).
    -   `.gitignore`, `readme.md`, etc.: Standard files for the Stencil starter.
-   **Root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:** Implicitly includes `packages/core` via the `packages/*` glob.

## Overall Current State

We have a functional Turborepo monorepo managed by pnpm. It includes:
1.  The necessary root configuration files.
2.  Example Next.js applications (`apps/docs`, `apps/web`) from the Turborepo starter.
3.  Example shared packages (`packages/@repo/ui`, `packages/@repo/eslint-config`, `packages/@repo/typescript-config`) from the Turborepo starter.
4.  The newly initialized Stencil component package (`packages/core`) which will contain the actual ODIN Drop-in web components.

## Next Steps (Based on MVP Requirements)

1.  **Clean up:** Remove or modify the unused example apps (`docs`, `web`) and the example UI package (`@repo/ui`).
2.  **Configure `core`:**
    *   Adjust `packages/core/stencil.config.ts` according to MVP requirements (e.g., namespace, output targets, potentially `shadow: false` initially for the main component).
    *   Rename/refactor the default `my-component` in `packages/core/src/components/` to reflect the actual ODIN drop-in component (e.g., `odin-cc-form`).
3.  **Create Facade Package:** Initialize the `packages/odin-dropin` package.
4.  **Configure Build:** Set up Vite within `packages/odin-dropin` for bundling and exposing the public API.
5.  **Implement Core Logic:** Start implementing the MVP functionality (CC form rendering using `OdinPay.js`, handling props like `odinPublicToken`, setting up callbacks) within the Stencil component in `packages/core`.
6.  **Create Demo App:** Initialize the `apps/demo` package for local testing.
