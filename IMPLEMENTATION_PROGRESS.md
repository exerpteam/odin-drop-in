# Project Initialization

## Current State

The project repository has been initialized as a basic Turborepo monorepo.

## Command Executed

The following command was likely run to achieve this state:

```bash
npx create-turbo@latest
```

(During the `create-turbo` process, `pnpm` would have been selected as the package manager, and a directory name like `odin-payments-dropin` might have been chosen).

## Key Files and Directories Created

This initialization step created the standard Turborepo boilerplate, including:

-   `apps/`: Directory intended for applications (like the demo app, potentially default example apps).
-   `packages/`: Directory intended for shared packages/libraries (like the Stencil core components, the facade package, potentially default example packages).
-   `.git/`: Git repository directory.
-   `.gitignore`: Standard Git ignore file.
-   `package.json`: Root package.json defining workspaces and scripts.
-   `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: Defines the pnpm workspace structure.
-   `turbo.json`: Turborepo configuration file.
-   `tsconfig.json` (or similar base tsconfig): Root TypeScript configuration.

## Summary

We have a foundational monorepo structure managed by Turborepo and pnpm, ready for the specific packages (`core`, `odin-dropin`, `demo`) to be created within it. The initial commit captures this boilerplate setup.
