# Project Implementation Progress

## 1. Initial Project Setup (Commits up to f1886c76)

### State

The project repository was initialized using Turborepo (`npx create-turbo@latest`). The initialization process involved applying the "official starter" template and specific transforms for pnpm and ESLint configuration. This provided a boilerplate including example applications (`docs`, `web`) and shared packages (`@repo/ui`, `@repo/eslint-config`, `@repo/typescript-config`).

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Initialize Turborepo project
npx create-turbo@latest

# (Interactive prompts followed)
# - Set project name (e.g., odin-dropin-workspace)
# - Select pnpm as package manager
# - Choose "official starter" template
# - Apply automated transforms
# - Install dependencies via pnpm install
```

### Key Files and Directories Created (Initial)

-   **Root Files:** `.git/`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `README.md`.
-   **`apps/` Directory:** `docs/` (Next.js), `web/` (Next.js).
-   **`packages/` Directory:** `@repo/ui/` (React components), `@repo/eslint-config/`, `@repo/typescript-config/`.

## 2. Core Component Package Initialization (Commit 841b6913)

### State

The foundational package (`core`) for the Stencil Web Components has been added to the monorepo under `packages/core`. This package will house the actual web component implementations. The package name in `package.json` is currently "core", and it includes the default Stencil starter component (`my-component`).

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Navigate to the packages directory (assuming root)
cd packages

# Create the directory for the core package
mkdir core
cd core

# Initialize the Stencil component starter using pnpm
# (Exact command might vary slightly based on pnpm/stencil versions)
pnpm init stencil component # or pnpm dlx create-stencil component .

# (Followed Stencil CLI prompts, likely accepting defaults)

# Navigate back to the root
cd ../..

# Optional: Run install again from the root if needed
# pnpm install
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **`packages/core/` Directory:**
    -   `package.json`: Defines the `core` package (`@stencil/core` dependency).
    -   `stencil.config.ts`: Initial Stencil build configuration.
    -   `tsconfig.json`: Initial TypeScript configuration for Stencil.
    -   `src/`: Source code for Stencil components (e.g., `components/my-component/`).
    -   Standard Stencil starter files (`.gitignore`, `readme.md`, etc.).
-   **Root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:** Implicitly includes `packages/core` via the `packages/*` glob.

## 3. Facade Package Setup (Commit e63b3df3)

### State

The basic structure for the public-facing facade package (`@exerp/odin-dropin`) has been created under `packages/odin-dropin`. A root `tsconfig.base.json` was also added for shared TypeScript settings across packages.

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Navigate to packages directory (assuming root)
cd packages

# Create the directory for the facade package
mkdir odin-dropin
cd odin-dropin

# Initialize package.json (likely manually or via pnpm init)
pnpm init # (or manually create package.json with name: @exerp/odin-dropin)

# Create tsconfig.json (manually, extending base)
touch tsconfig.json # (Content added extending base)

# Create src directory and placeholder index.ts
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts

# Navigate back to root
cd ../..

# Create root tsconfig.base.json (manually)
touch tsconfig.base.json # (Content added with base TS options)

# Optional: Run install again from the root
# pnpm install
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **`packages/odin-dropin/` Directory:**
    -   `package.json`: Defines the `@exerp/odin-dropin` package.
    -   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration, extending `../../tsconfig.base.json`.
    -   `src/index.ts`: Placeholder facade entry point.
-   **Root `tsconfig.base.json`:** Created to hold shared TypeScript compiler options.
-   **Root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:** Implicitly includes `packages/odin-dropin` via the `packages/*` glob.

## 4. Boilerplate Cleanup & Root Configuration Update (Commit a7ca27aa)

### State

The initial boilerplate generated by `create-turbo` has been cleaned up to remove unused example applications and shared packages. Root configuration files have been updated to match the current project structure and scope (core Stencil components + facade).

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Remove example applications (assuming root)
rm -rf apps/docs
rm -rf apps/web

# Remove example shared packages (assuming root)
rm -rf packages/ui
rm -rf packages/eslint-config
rm -rf packages/typescript-config

# Manually edit root configuration files:
# - pnpm-workspace.yaml: Updated paths (commented out apps/*).
# - package.json: Removed devDependencies related to removed packages (eslint, ts-config), simplified scripts.
# - turbo.json: Updated tasks, removing pipelines related to removed apps/packages.
# - README.md: Updated with MVP requirement details.

# Optional: Run install again from root to update lockfile
# pnpm install
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **Removed:** `apps/docs`, `apps/web`, `packages/ui`, `packages/eslint-config`, `packages/typescript-config`.
-   **Modified:**
    -   `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: Updated paths (only `packages/*` active).
    -   `package.json`: Simplified dependencies and scripts.
    -   `turbo.json`: Adjusted task configurations.
    -   `README.md`: Content updated to match `6-DropIn-MVP-Implementation.md`.

## 5. Core Package Configuration & Initial Build Fix Attempt (Commit 91a7120c)

### State

The Stencil component package (`packages/core`) has been configured. The namespace is set, output targets (`dist`, `dist-custom-elements`) are defined, and unnecessary ones (`www`, `docs-readme`) have been removed. The `tsconfig.json` for the core package has been updated to extend the root `tsconfig.base.json` and includes specific settings required by Stencil. Notably, `moduleResolution` was set to `"node"` in an attempt to resolve a TypeScript build error related to Puppeteer types (`Cannot find module 'chromium-bidi/protocol/protocol.js'`) observed during the initial build (`packages/core/.turbo/turbo-build.log`). `skipLibCheck` was also enabled. The root `turbo.json` build task outputs were updated to include Stencil-specific artifacts (`loader/**`, `.stencil/**`).

### Commands Executed & Process

```bash
# Manually edit configuration files:
# - packages/core/stencil.config.ts: Adjusted namespace, outputTargets.
# - packages/core/tsconfig.json: Extended base, added Stencil options, set moduleResolution="node", skipLibCheck=true.
# - turbo.json: Updated build.outputs.

# Run build (likely triggered implicitly or explicitly)
# pnpm turbo build # This would show if the tsconfig changes fixed the Puppeteer error
```

### Key Files and Directories Added/Modified

-   **Modified:**
    -   `packages/core/stencil.config.ts`:
        -   Set `namespace: 'exerp-odin-dropin-core'`.
        -   Configured `outputTargets` for `dist` and `dist-custom-elements`.
        -   Removed `docs-readme` and `www` output targets.
        -   Set `testing.browserHeadless = 'shell'`.
    -   `packages/core/tsconfig.json`:
        -   Added `"extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json"`.
        -   Set/overrode compiler options for Stencil (e.g., `jsx`, `jsxFactory`, `experimentalDecorators`).
        -   Set `moduleResolution: "node"` (attempting to fix Puppeteer type error).
        -   Set `skipLibCheck: true`.
    -   `turbo.json`:
        -   Added `loader/**` and `.stencil/**` to `tasks.build.outputs`.

## Overall Current State

We have a streamlined Turborepo monorepo managed by pnpm, specifically set up for the ODIN Drop-in component:
1.  **Root configuration files:** `package.json`, `turbo.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `.gitignore`, etc., are configured for the current structure.
2.  **Core Package:** `packages/core` contains the initialized and configured Stencil project (namespace `exerp-odin-dropin-core`, build outputs defined). It still contains the default component `my-component`. The Puppeteer build error has been addressed in `tsconfig.json`, but verification is needed.
3.  **Facade Package:** `packages/odin-dropin` contains the basic structure (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/index.ts`) for the public API facade, named `@exerp/odin-dropin`.
4.  **No example apps/packages:** The initial boilerplate examples have been removed.
5.  A root `README.md` provides initial project context (copied from the MVP requirements).

## Next Steps (Based on MVP Requirements - `6-DropIn-MVP-Implementation.md`)

1.  **Verify Build & Refactor `core`:**
    *   Run `pnpm turbo build` to confirm the Puppeteer/TypeScript build issue in `packages/core` is resolved by the `tsconfig.json` changes. If not, further investigate (`moduleResolution: node16/nodenext`, type versions, etc.). üìù
    *   Rename/refactor the default `my-component` in `packages/core/src/components/` to reflect the actual ODIN drop-in component (e.g., `odin-cc-form`).
2.  **Configure Build for Facade:** Set up Vite within `packages/odin-dropin` for bundling (ESM, UMD, CJS), dependency handling (`core`), CSS extraction (from Stencil), and `.d.ts` generation.
3.  **Implement Core Logic:** Start implementing the MVP functionality (CC form rendering using `OdinPay.js`, handling props like `odinPublicToken`, `isSingleUse`, setting up callbacks) within the Stencil component in `packages/core`.
4.  **Implement Facade Logic:** Implement the public `OdinDropin` class/functions in `packages/odin-dropin/src/index.ts` to load/initialize the Stencil component from `core` and manage the public API (`initialize`, `mount`, callbacks).
5.  **Create Demo App:** Initialize an `apps/demo` package for local testing, consuming `@exerp/odin-dropin`.
